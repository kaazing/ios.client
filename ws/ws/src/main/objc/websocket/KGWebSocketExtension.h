 */

// TODO: this can be uncommented in future when custom WebSocket extension is exposed.
/*
 * *For Example*
 * Lets say you want to define a custom extension *CustomExtension* that is 
 * negotiated during WebSocket protocol handshake and the custom extension consists of 
 * two parameters - *foo* and *bar*. Let's say parameter *bar* is anonymous required parameter 
 * i.e only the value of the parameter is written on the wire.
 *
 * *IMPORTANT:* It is highly recommended to not to have multiple anonymous required
 *              parameters as it may result in ambiguity. The multiple anonymous
 *              parameters are usualy processed in the order they are defined.
 *
 * *CustomExtension.h*
 * <pre><code>
 * @interface CustomExtension : KGWebSocketExtension
 * + (CustomExtension *) customExtension;
 *
 * @end
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * The CustomExtension implementation defines the singleton instances of the extension itself and 
 * the extension parameters. They are basically definition objects that does not change once defined.
 *
