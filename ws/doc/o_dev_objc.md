Build Objective-C (iOS) WebSocket Clients
=========================================

**Note:** To use the Gateway, a KAAZING client library, or a KAAZING demo, fork the repository from [kaazing.org](http://kaazing.org).

This checklist provides the steps necessary to create an Objective-C client using the KAAZING Gateway [Objective-C Client API](../apidoc/client/ios/gateway/index.md):

Introduction
------------

In this how-to, you will learn how to use the KAAZING Gateway Objective-C client library to enable your iOS client to communicate with any back-end service over WebSocket via the KAAZING Gateway or any RFC-6455 WebSocket endpoint.

This document contains information for an Objective-C developer who wants to add Objective-C to an iOS client to enable communication with a back-end server through KAAZING Gateway or any RFC-6455 WebSocket endpoint.

For more information on the Objective-C API, see [Objective-C Client API](../apidoc/client/ios/gateway/index.md).

WebSocket and Objective-C
-------------------------

KAAZING Gateway provides support for the HTML5 Communication protocol libraries in Objective-C. Using the Objective-C Client API, you can enable the HTML5 WebSocket protocols in new or existing Objective-C applications. For example, you can create an Objective-C client to get streaming financial or news data from a back-end server using WebSocket. The following figure shows a high-level overview of the architecture:
